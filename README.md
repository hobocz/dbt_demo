## About The Project
- This is a simple dbt project meant to demonstrate core functionality. 
- **Please note**: This is a work in progress and I am going for *breadth, not depth*. I will
continue to add both as I progress.
- In practice this project uses Snowflake as the data warehouse.
- Included examples:
    - Multiple models and sources with differing materializations
    - Multiple basic test examples
    - A simple snapshot
    - Some basic macros
    - Some simple documentation
